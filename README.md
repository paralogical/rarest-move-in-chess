This is a lil' code to analyze chess .pgn files, with the goal of finding the "rarest" move in chess.

That is, the rarest move notation (standard algebraic notation) given a large number of input games (e.g. every rated game from lichess) in pgn format.

However, since there are many moves that never happen, this is moreso counting and categorizing moves of various types rather than finding one specific rare move.

[See the video about this data here](https://youtu.be/iDnW0WiCqNc)

## Running

This was written using zig 0.12.0.

This analysis is done in 2 separate phases (and hence programs)

1. Read pgn data from stdin, count moves, store in a move string => int mapping, save data to a temporary .result.json file
   - We also save games that contain rare moves to use as examples
   - We also save some statistics like total games processed and total bytes processed
2. Read multiple .result.json files, merge into one map of move => count. Perform analysis on these moves.

- Phase 1 can be run with `zig build run -- collect < games.pgn > result.json` or `zstdcat ./compressed/lichess_20XX-YY.pgn.zst | zig build run -- collect > result.json` if using compressed data from lichess.
  - Note: you should use `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` here since this is a slow process for recent months of data.
  - This parses ~100k games / sec on my machine, but running multiple instances of this script allows processing multiple months in parallel. I could get ~400k games / sec this way. Recent months from Lichess are ~30GB compressed, which takes ~15 min to process at 100k games / sec.
- Phase 2 can be run with `zig build run -- analyze partialResults/`.
  - This loads all `.result.json` games in the `partialResults/` folder, and prints analysis out to stdout.

## About

Note that pgn files used in my analysis are not included in this repo, because I used 1500 Gigabytes of them.
This repo _does_ include the counts of encountered moves from the pgn files I analyzed (the .result.json files from the _collect_ phase).

The interesting stuff happens in the analyze phase.
It counts how many moves are of different forms, like promotions, disambiguations, etc.
We also look for the percent "coverage" we get, by comparing how many moves of different pieces we see compared to how many we could theoretically see.
See src/analyze.zig for the logic that counts how many possible moves there are.

There's also a couple of scripts here to help compute how many possible moves there are using a python chess library. (this is used to find the % coverage)

Why is this written in zig? Just for funzies

## Results

_**Update**: This repo now contains additional data from 2024. The analysis shown in this README does not include this updated data.
Use `zig build run -- analyze partialResults/` to see the analysis with updated data.
This includes people achieving the "rarest move"._

I analyzed all of the [rated game data from lichess](https://database.lichess.org/#standard_games) between July 2014 and December 2023.

This analysis included **342,490,585,837 moves** from **5,163,425,477 games**, from **9.4TB** of uncompressed pgn game data.

Note that before July 2014, there seems to be some bug in the Lichess game data that reports some moves
not in their most simple form, for example,
there are some doubly disambiguated rook moves (this is never necessary)
and some doubly disambiguated knight moves that could be expressed as rank or file disambiguations.
Hence data before July 2014 is excluded. It's a measely 8,247,741 games, or 0.1% of total games excluded.

I also looked at a few more smaller datasets but they're so few games I excluded them from the analysis.

Some categories of rare moves are:

- Doubly Disambiguated Queen capture checkmates, like Qc3xd4#
- Rank-Disambiguated Bishop capture checkmates, like B3xd4#
- Doubly Disambiguated Knight _Non-Capture_ Checkmates like Na1b3# (So far exactly 1 example of this)
- Doubly Disambiguated Knight Capture Checkmates like Na1xb3# (I've never seen an example of this)
- Doubly Disambiguated Bishop Capture Checkmates like Bb3xc4# (I've never seen an example of this)

Each of these has less-rare variants like non-capture mates, capture with check, etc.

Much of the rarity and interesting cases come from disambiguations inherent to standard algebraic notation,
but you could argue this is purely a property of the notation, and not really related to chess.
If you prefer not including disambiguations, see simplified_results.json which strips out check, checkmate and disambiguations
to give an ordered list of moves. According to that method, the rarest move is `fxg1=B`.
I enjoy the additional complication of the notational rarity, which is what the bulk of this analysis focuses on.

Running the analysis with the included partialResults gives this output:
